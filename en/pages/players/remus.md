## Origin

Thilenedall, the Ancient Oak Tree (small enclave of Sciuirians inside the Thilenedalian kingdom)
Hook: In search of the legacy of his grandfather Sir Remus Nutsworth.
Sir Remus Nutsworth was the one to slay the ancient Vampire Gulthias in the Sunless Citadel. Old folk still tell the tale of the dapper furry hero.
Remus wants to follow in his grandfather’s footsteps. He’s following his trail. Remus one day left on an adventure but never came back.
Remus has actually ascended and has become a demigod. 

### Medaillon of the Mother Tree

People that truly knew Sir Remus well will attest that contrary to depictions and statues of Sir Remus, he did not wear shiny armor when he wandered about Pevnina. He was clad in simple robes and only ever wore his medaillon. He didn’t even carry a sword with him.

Felgolos has seen how Sir Remus grew vines and branches around his body to deflect the arcane delivered onto him by Othorion.
