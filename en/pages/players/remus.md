# Remus Nutsworth

**Played by:** Wim

**Race:** Red Sciuirian

**Class:** Paladin, Oath of the Ancients

## Origin

Thilenedall, the Ancient Oak Tree (small enclave of Sciuirians inside the Thilenedalian kingdom)
Hook: In search of the legacy of his grandfather Sir Remus Nutsworth.
Sir Remus Nutsworth was the one to slay the ancient Vampire Gulthias in the Sunless Citadel. Old folk still tell the tale of the dapper furry hero.
Remus wants to follow in his grandfather’s footsteps. He’s following his trail. Remus one day left on an adventure but never came back.
Remus has actually ascended and has become a demigod. 

### Medaillon of the Mother Tree

People that truly knew Sir Remus well will attest that contrary to depictions and statues of Sir Remus, he did not wear shiny armor when he wandered about Pevnina. He was clad in simple robes and only ever wore his medaillon. He didn’t even carry a sword with him.
Felgolos has seen how Sir Remus grew vines and branches around his body to deflect the arcane delivered onto him by Othorion.

**Medaillon of the Mother Tree**
Magic item, requires attunement
The wielder of the acorn, if worthy, can summon the protection of Shae and Ferulian. As the wielder proves himself as a true ally to them, the medaillon becomes more powerful

**Dormant**

As an action you can cause armor to grow from the medaillon. A weave of branches, vines, leaves and other natural materials cover your body and keep moving around. Shifting density to points of proximity. Donning and doffing the armor only takes 6 seconds.
The armor is light armor and has a base AC of 13.

**Awakened**

The armors base AC is 14. Once per long rest, when you take damage you can focus the armor to protect against the damage type. You then gain resistance to this type of damage. This can not be done for psychic damage.

**Exalted**

The armors base AC is 15. Instead of becoming resistant the armor now grants immunity to the focused damage. Furthermore, attempts to initiate or maintain a grapple on the wielder are done at disadvantage as the vines grow thorns and wriggle about.
